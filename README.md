# Flower Growing Game

A fun game where you can plant seeds and watch them grow into beautiful flowers!

## How to Play

1. Run the game by opening a terminal and typing:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. To plant a seed:
   - Click on a seed box in the toolbar (brown rectangles) to pick up a seed
   - Click in the garden area (top part of the screen) to plant it

3. Help your flowers grow:
   - Click the water button (blue, bottom left) to water plants
   - Click the sun button (yellow, bottom right) to give sunlight
   - For best growth, alternate between water and sun!

4. Collect and manage seeds:
   - When flowers are fully grown, they will produce seeds
   - After some time, flowers will die and drop their seeds to the ground
   - Simply click near a seed to collect it - it will automatically go to your seed storage
   - You don't need to click exactly on the seed - clicking close to it works too!
   - Seeds are organized by type in the toolbar (roses, sunflowers, daisies)
   - Each seed type has its own storage slot with a counter showing how many you have
   - Left-click anywhere in a seed box to pick up a seed when you want to plant it
   - Right-click on a seed box to automatically plant a random seed of that type!
   - You can collect as many seeds as you want!

5. Using the scissors:
   - Click the scissors button (gray, near bottom right) to select the scissors tool
   - When scissors are selected, they will follow your mouse cursor
   - Click near any flowers with buds or blooms to cut them down
   - The scissors will cut all flowers in the same horizontal area
   - When cut, flowers will die and drop their seeds to the ground
   - You'll need to collect the seeds manually after cutting
   - You can use the scissors as many times as you want!

6. Types of flowers:
   - Rose (red)
